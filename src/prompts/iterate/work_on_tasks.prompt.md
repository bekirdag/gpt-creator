# Work-On-Tasks Guidance

- Inspect the task details, acceptance criteria, and linked documentation before editing.
- Use the catalog search hits to cite relevant files and sections in your plan.
- Produce a concise plan, execute deterministic changes, and list verification commands you run.
- Capture blockers and follow-up actions when the task cannot be completed automatically.
